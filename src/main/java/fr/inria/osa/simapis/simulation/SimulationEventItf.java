 * Defines the API for OSA events.
 * 
 * <p>
 * OSA events are similar to functor objects, that is an object that contains a
 * method to be executed along with its arguments, and the virtual simulation
 * time at which to schedule the execution. However, to be consistent with the
 * encapsulation principles of Fractal, events can only be created and executed
 * within the component that owns the (the class that owns the) method scheduled
 * by the event. Because of this limitation the OSA event API is mostly internal
 * because events are created internally by the simulation controller of the
 * component that owns the method scheduled in the event.
