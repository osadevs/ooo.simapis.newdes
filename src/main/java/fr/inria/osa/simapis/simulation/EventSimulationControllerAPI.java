/**
 * Control interface of the OSA simulation controller.
 * 
 * The simulation controller is in charge of implementing the simulation
 * engine in a distributed way, within the Fractal component membrane of 
 * each simulation model component.
 * 
 * The client of this interface is typically a super-scheduler component.
 * 
 * 
 * This API provides the means to initialize and start the simulation
 * service.
 * 
 * Here are time-sequences for various scenarios:
 * 
 * <ol type="A" > 
 *   <li> Initialization:
 *   
 *   <ol type="1">
 *   <li> Launcher thread creates an instance of the root model component (eg. using ADL factory)
 *   
 *   <li> Launcher thread creates a (super-)scheduler component and binds it to model components.
 *   
 *	<li> Launcher thread uses the model component LCC to start components
 *
 *	<li> Launcher thread calls the super-scheduler's (or root's) startSimulation()
 *  method
 *  
 *  <li> startSimulation calls each model primitive component's init() method
 *  
 *  <li> each model component with pending events registers the first pending event 
 *  using the wakeMeUp method
 *  
 *   </ol>
 *   
 *   <li> Main loop:
 * 
 * <p> 1. initial invariant state: super-scheduler thread ready for a new iteration,
 * all other simulation threads are sleeping (eg. blocked on a semaphore). All 
 * simulation components with at least one pending event are assumed to
 * have called wakeMeUp with parameters corresponding to first pending event (time,
 * event type, event id).
 * 
 * <p> 2. superscheduler.mainloop() looks for first entry in the global pending event set.
 * 
 * <p> 3-a. case ASYNC: super-scheduler CALLS simc resume(current_time)
 * 
 * <p> 4. (SC Thread) simC dequeues next pending event and advances local time
 * 
 * <p> 5. (SC Thread) simC looks up queue head and calls wakeMeUp with next entry
 * 
 * <p> 6. (async, SC Thread) simC starts a new thread and invokes the dequeued event 
 * execution
 * 
 * <p> 7-a. (SC Thread) resume returns true if a thread was created in the simulation component.
 * 
 * <p> 7-b. (simC Thread) The threads executes as long as possible for the 
 * current date until it either (8-a) terminates or it (8-b) reaches a 
 * simulation wait instruction
 * 
 * <p> 8-a. (simC Thread) the running thread calls the 
 * eventComplete(current time, sync=f)  
 * which wakes up the SC Thread while simC Thread releases itself.
 * 
 * <p> 8-b. (simC Thread, possibly in another simC) creates a wake up event 
 * for resuming execution later when the wait delay has expired. If the 
 * time of resuming is earlier than previous head of queue in current simC, 
 * simC thread calls wakeMeUp to update status. Finally, the simC thread calls
 * eventStopped(current time) and goes to sleep until the wake up event 
 * is called.
 * 
 * <p> 8. (async, SC Thread) superscheduler.main() goes to sleep until either 
 * eventComplete() or eventStopped() is called.
 * 
 * <p> 9. (SC Thread) eventComplete/eventStopped update the current 
 * simulation time and supersched.main() returns to 1.
 *  
 * <p> 3-b. case SYNC: super-scheduler calls simc resume(current_time, sync=t)
 * 
 * <p> 4. - 5. idem
 * 
 * <p> 6. (sync, SC thread) invokes the dequeued event 
 * 
 * <p> 7. (sync, SC thread) executes business code until 
 * eventComplete(current time, sync=t) is called. 
 * NB: the sync flag can be automatically assigned by assessing if
 * current thread == SC Thread. (eventStopped not allowed in sync mode)
 * 
 * <p> 8. (sync) jump to 9.
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>NB: Comparable is not strictly necessary, it is just to help using this type
 * in more cmplex ones that require natural ordering (eg. Guava's TreeMultimap).
