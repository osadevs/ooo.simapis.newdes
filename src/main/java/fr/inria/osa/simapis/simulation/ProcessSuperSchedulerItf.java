 * The super-scheduler is in charge of the synchronization and coordination between the

 * <p>The SuperScheduler is a standard Fractal component. It is connected (bound) to
 * every {@link AbstractProcessModel} component to which it provides a number of centralized
 * functions to ensure the proper execution of the simulation, such as:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Starting and stopping the simulation
 * <li> Keeping track of the global (virtual) time of the simulation
 * <li> Queuing and activating the components according to the time order of their
 * next pending events
 * <li> Synchronization of user defined wait queues
 * </ul>
